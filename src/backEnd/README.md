# Backend Documentation
## Description
This backend is hosted on GCP App Engine to preform person recognition using AutoML to identify pictures sent over the API. This backend consists of an API written in Python Flask that hits the AutoML API and returns the identification. There is also a React frontend used to see information on who walked in.
