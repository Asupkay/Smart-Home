# Backend Documentation
## Description
This is a python backend hosted on GCP App Engine that uses AutoML to perform person recognition to identify pictures sent over the API. This backend consists of an API written in Python Flask that hits the AutoML API that returns the identification. There is also a React frontend used to see information on who walked in.
